# On-demand Forecast Model

## Introduction


To run an ML model as part of your pipeline, using Azure machine learning, on top of a curated set you can follow the instructions given below. By following the instruction you can build an ML model, make its execution part of the ADF pipeline and then use Power BI for visualization. 

## Steps

Following is the link with detailed steps for implementing on-demand machine learning model:
