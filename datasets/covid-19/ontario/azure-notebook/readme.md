# Azure Synapse Notebook

## Introduction

A Synapse Studio (preview) notebook is a web interface for you to create files that contain live code, visualizations, and narrative text. Notebooks are a good place to validate ideas and use quick experiments to get insights from your data. Notebooks are also widely used in data preparation, data visualization, machine learning, and other Big Data scenarios.

With an Azure Synapse Studio notebook, you can:

- Get started with zero setup effort.
- Keep data secure with built-in enterprise security features.
- Analyze data across raw formats (CSV, txt, JSON, etc.), processed file formats (parquet, Delta Lake, ORC, etc.), and SQL tabular data files against Spark and SQL.
- Be productive with enhanced authoring capabilities and built-in data visualization.

## Steps

### Note: The above link documents the implementation of Azure Synapse Notebook for a different dataset. However, you can use this dataset as well by simply updating the blob URL. Please note that this blob URL must point to the dataset that you want to analyse.
